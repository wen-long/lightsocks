FAQ

Q: How to setup git ssh with Github?

A: Edit `config.json`, set `target_server` to `github.com`, set `target_port`
 to `22`. Run `python lightsocks.py`   
 
Edit ~/.ssh/config, add the following:

    host github.com
    port 1082
    hostname 127.0.0.1

Replace `1082` with your `local_port` if your `local_port` is not 1082. Then
you can `git clone git@github.com:myname/myrepo.git`

Q: What about git:// protocol?

A: Similar to the above. But you'll set both `target_port` and `local_port` 
to 9418. Then add '127.0.0.1 github.com' in your `/etc/hosts` file.
Then you can `git clone git://github.com/clowwindy/shadowsocks.git`
